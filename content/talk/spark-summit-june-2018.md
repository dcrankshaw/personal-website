abstract = "Machine learning is being deployed in a growing number of applications which demand real-time, accurate, and robust predictions under heavy serving loads. However, most machine learning frameworks and systems only address model training and not deployment. Clipper is an open-source, general-purpose model-serving system that addresses these challenges. Interposing between applications that consume predictions and the machine-learning models that produce predictions, Clipper simplifies the model deployment process by adopting a modular serving architecture and isolating models in their own containers, allowing them to be evaluated using the same runtime environment as that used during training. Clipperâ€™s modular architecture provides simple mechanisms for scaling out models to meet increased throughput demands and performing fine-grained physical resource allocation for each model. Further, by abstracting models behind a uniform serving interface, Clipper allows developers to compose many machine-learning models within a single application to support increasingly common techniques such as ensemble methods, multi-armed bandit algorithms, and prediction cascades. In this talk I will provide an overview of the Clipper serving system and discuss how to get started using Clipper to serve Apache Spark and TensorFlow models on Kubernetes. I will then discuss some recent work on statistical performance monitoring for machine learning models."
